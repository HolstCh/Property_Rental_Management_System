# Property_Rental_Management_System
A property rental management program that consisted of requirements that needed to be met for three user types defined by our professor. We
designed the program using a use case diagram, sequence diagrams, state diagrams, UML, and activity diagrams. The application was created with 
Java, MySQL, and Swing (GUI).
