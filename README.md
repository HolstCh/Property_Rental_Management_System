# Property Rental Management System
A property rental management program that consisted of requirements that needed to be met for three user types defined by our professor. We
designed the program using a use case diagram, sequence diagrams, state diagram, UML, and an activity diagram. The application was created with 
Java, MySQL, and Swing (GUI). The program follows MVC architecture with folders which seperate the database, controllers, and UI.
